<h1>ascii-art-fs test file</h1>

This test file will check your ascii-art-fs project against the first 10 test cases on the intra audit web page, simultaneously.

The files **ascii-art-fs_test.go** and **test-cases.txt** need to be placed into your project folder, this is the same folder that your main project file is located.

If you are on mac and you haven't created a mod file then you may need to by running "go mod init asciiArtFS", you can replace asciiArtFS with a name of your choosing. To run the test file you simply need to open a terminal in the project folder and run the following command:<br/>

***go test***

If your project passed the test the output should be as follows(with a varying amount of time taken):

If it failed it should appear as so:
